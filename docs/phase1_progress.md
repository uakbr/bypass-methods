## Integration with Existing Framework
- The DirectX hook system will eventually be integrated with the existing accessibility-based framework
- Planned approach is to add a new Named Pipe message type for requesting screen captures
- Will expose an API for capturing specific windows or screen regions
- Need to ensure compatibility with the current accessibility controller
