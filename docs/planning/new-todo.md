# UndownUnlock Project: Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
UndownUnlock is a sophisticated DirectX and Windows API hooking framework designed for educational purposes. It intercepts graphics API calls and Windows system functions to enable frame extraction, window management control, and other system-level monitoring capabilities.
